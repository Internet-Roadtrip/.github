## 🚗 What is Internet Road Trip?

Internet Road Trip is a digital adventure. We curate, create, and celebrate the vast and weird world of the internet. Think of it as a modern mixtape of links, stories, tools, and discoveries — all bundled into a journey worth taking.

Whether you're a builder, browser, or backseat driver, there's something here for you.

## 🧭 What You'll Find Here

- 🧩 **Projects**: Tools, experiments, and open-source components that power or extend the road trip.
- 📝 **Discussions**: Ideas and planning for future routes, themes, and collaborative side quests.
- 💡 **Resources**: Collected wisdom from fellow travelers — from indie websites to web archaeology.
